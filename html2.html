  <h3>HTML</h3>
  <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
    creating web pages and web applications.Web browsers receive HTML documents
    from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web
    pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
    originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

  <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
    images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into
    the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by
    denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
    links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
    using angle brackets.</p>
